Here we will keep all of our ideas for game mechanics, design features, etc.:
-A modular character (i.e. upgrades to a mech suit are picked up throughout a level)

Here we will keep all goals for the end product (however achievable they may be):
-Port to C so it is easy to run across platforms


Design Ideas
-Thinking 2D side scrolling platformer. Been playing Ori and the Blind Forest recently and iz pretty gud
-Eman seems pretty obsessed with a multiplayer mech mode, so thinking we have something where part of the main method of progression is to use
different kinds of mechs as the situation requires each level
	- Maybe for multiplayer competitive (since eman seems equally fixed on that) different mechs drop randomly, or the mechs are like "classes"
	where one has strengths that exploit the weaknesses of another, and vice versa? Maybe that'd be too hard to balance
