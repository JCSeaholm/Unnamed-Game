Here we will keep all of our ideas for game mechanics, design features, etc.:
-A modular character (i.e. upgrades to a mech suit are picked up throughout a level)
-Thinking game features should be something like league, where as the game goes on
 the characters will scale and grow bigger

Here we will keep all goals for the end product (however achievable they may be):
-Port to C so it is easy to run across platforms

What we try to build towards for our early game life:
-idk
-like basic functionalities
-Some features we should try to work on
